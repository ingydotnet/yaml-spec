## Problem

Implicit flow collections currently require an unbounded look-ahead, since they may or may not be block mapping keys.


## Proposal

Block mapping keys that are flow collections must be explicitly marked as such with the `?` indicator.


## Explanation

When a parser sees a flow collection, it must check for a colon after the collection has terminated.

YAML 1.2 imposes a 1024 character limit if the collection is intended to become a key.

This is a poor solution and places too much burden on parser implementations.

Collection keys are not a commonly used feature.

Under this RFC proposal, the following form will become invalid:
```
[4, 2]: 42
```

And will need to be written as:
```
? [4, 2]
: 42
```

Combined with [RFC-002](RFC-002.md) we can make it use one line:
```
? [4, 2]: 42
```

and get rid of the look-ahead simply by adding `? ` before entries.
